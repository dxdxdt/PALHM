# Periodic Automatic Live Host Maintenance (PALHM)
This is a script that automates periodic maintenance of a machine. PALHM covers
a routinely sequential command run as well as "hot" or "live" back up of the
running host to a backend of your choice.

PALHM addresses problems of the traditional lazy method of making a copy of the
entirety of drives.

* Use of high-level data dump tools like mysqldump and slapcat
* Not including data obtainable from the modern package manager such as the
  contents of /usr to reduce cost
* Dump of metadata crucial when restoring from backup via use of tools like
  lsblk

The safest way to back up has always been by getting the system offline and
tar'ing the file system or making an image of the storage device. This may not
be practical in set ups where downtime is unacceptable or allocating more
resources for a backup task is not cost-efficient. This is where this script
comes in to play.

## TL;DR
Goto [#Examples](#examples).

## Routine Task
The Routine Task is a set of routines that are executed sequentially. It can
consist of commands(Execs) and other previously defined tasks. Routine Tasks are
absolute basic - you may incorporate custom shell scripts or other executables
to do complex routines.

## Backup Task
PALHM supports backup on different storage backends. It also automates rotation
of backup copies on the supported storage backends. **aws-s3** and **localfs**
are currently implemented. You may incorporate localfs to store backups on NFS
or Samba mount points. The special **null** backend is for testing purposes.

The files produced as end product of backup are called "Backup Objects". The
Backup Objects have two essential attributes.

* **pipeline**: commands used to generate the backup output file
* **path**: path to the output file on the backend

For example, this object definition is for a mysql data dump compressed in zstd
and encrypted using a public key id "backup-pub-key" named as
"all-db.sql.zstd.pgp".

```jsonc
{
  "path": "all-db.sql.zstd.pgp",
  "pipeline": [
    { "type": "exec-inline", "argv": [ "/bin/mysqldump", "-uroot", "--all-databases" ] },
    { "type": "exec-inline", "argv": [ "/bin/zstd" ] },
    { "type": "exec-inline", "argv": [ "/bin/gpg", "-e", "-r", "backup-pub-key", "--compress-algo", "none" ] }
  ]
}
```

This is equivalent of doing this from the shell

```sh
mysqldump -uroot --all-databases | zstd | gpg -e -r backup-pub-key --compress-algo none > all-db.sql.zstd.pgp
```

except that the output file can be placed on the cloud service depending on the
backend used. The frequently used commands like "compression filters" are
defined in the core
config([conf.d/core.json](src/conf/py-sample/conf.d/core.json)) as Exec
definitions.

### Backup Object Path
The final path for a Backup Object is formulated as follows.

```
localfs:
 /media/backup/localhost/2022-05-01T06:59:17+00:00/all-db.sql.zstd.pgp
|         ROOT          |         PREFIX          |       PATH        |

aws-s3:
 s3://your-s3-bucket/backup/your-host/2022-05-01T06:59:17+00:00/all-db.sql.zstd.pgp
     |    BUCKET    |      ROOT      |         PREFIX          |       PATH        |
```

| ATTR | DESC |
| - | - |
| ROOT | The root directory for backup |
| PREFIX | The name of the backup |
| PATH | The output path of the backup object |

The default format of PREFIX is the output of `date --utc --iso-8601=seconds`.
Backup rotation is performed using PREFIX. The PREFIX must be based on values
that, when sorted in ascending order, the oldest backup should appear first.

PATH may contain the directory separator("/" or "\\"). The backend may or may
not support this. The localfs backend handles this by doing `mkdir -p` on path
before creating a "sink" for output files. Using "/" for PATH on Windows will
fail as per NTFS limitation. The aws-s3 backend will pass the directory
separator "/" through to Boto3 API and sub directory objects will be created
implicitly.

### Backend-param
The parameters specific to backup backends can be set using backend-param. Here
are parameters commonly appear across backends.

* root: (string) the path to the backup root
* nb-copy-limit: (decimal) the number of most recent backups to keep
* root-size-limit: (decimal) the total size of the backup root in bytes
* prefix: (TODO) reserved for future

The value of the decimal type is either a JSON number or a string that
represents a decimal number. The IEEE754 infinity representation("inf",
"Infinity", "-inf" or "-Infinity") can be used for *nb-copy-limit* and
*root-size-limit* to disable both or either of the attributes. The decimal type
is not affected by the limit of IEEE754 type(the 2^53 integer part). The
fractional part of the numbers are ignored as they are compared against the
integers.

#### Localfs
```jsonc
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "backup",
      "type": "backup",
      "backend": "localfs",
      "backend-param": {
        "root": "/media/backup/localhost", // (required)
        "dmode": "755", // (optional) mode for new directories
        "fmode": "644", // (optional) mode for new files
        "nb-copy-limit": "Infinity", // (optional)
        "root-size-limit": "Infinity" // (optional)
      },
      "object-groups": [ /* ... */ ],
      "objects": [ /* ... */ ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### aws-s3
```jsonc
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "backup",
      "type": "backup",
      "backend": "aws-s3",
      "backend-param": {
        "profile": "default", // (optional) AWS client profile. Defaults to "default"
        "bucket": "palhm.test", // (required) S3 bucket name
        "root": "/palhm/backup", // (required)
        "sink-storage-class": "STANDARD", // (optional) storage class for new uploads
        "rot-storage-class": "STANDARD", // (optional) storage class for final uploads
        "nb-copy-limit": "Infinity", // (optional)
        "root-size-limit": "Infinity" // (optional)
      },
      "object-groups": [ /* ... */ ],
      "objects": [ /* ... */ ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For profiles configured for root, see `~/.aws/config`. Run `aws configure help`
for more info.

For possible values for storage class, run `aws s3 cp help`.

If you wish to keep backup copies in Glacier, you may want to upload backup
objects as STANDARD-IA first and change the storage class to GLACIER on the
rotate stage because in the event of failure, PALHM rolls back the process by
deleting objects already uploaded to the bucket. You may be charged for the
objects stored in Glacier as the minimum storage duration is 90 days(as of
2022). The **rot-storage-class** attribute serves this very purpose. More info
on [the pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

### Backup Object Dependency Tree
Backup objects can be configured to form a dependency tree like Makefile
objects. By default, PALHM builds backup files simultaneously(*nb-workers*). On
some environments, this may not be desirable, especially on system with
HDDs[^1]. You can tune this behaviour by either ...

* Setting *nb-workers* to 1
* Grouping the backup objects so that the objects from one storage device are
  built sequentially

Say the system has one storage device that holds all data necessary for service
and another one on which OS is installed. The system services static HTTP, MySQL
and OpenLDAP. All the backup tasks need to be grouped separately in order to
reduce IO seek time.

```jsonc
{
  "object-groups": [
    { "id": "root" },
    { "id": "http" },
    { "id": "sql", "depends": [ "http" ] },
    { "id": "ldap", "depends": [ "sql" ] },
  ]
}
```

On start, the objects in "root" and "http" groups will be built simultanesouly.
On completion of all the objects in "http", the objects in the group "sql" and
"ldap" will be built in order.

### Testing Config
When writing backup task, if you're worried about data loss caused by
misconfiguration or vulnerabilities, you can use [systemd's
sandboxing](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Sandboxing)
to test out your config. The distro must be running Systemd in order for this to
work.

```sh
systemd-run -qP -p Nice=15 -p ProtectSystem=strict -p ReadOnlyPaths=/ -p PrivateDevices=true --wait /usr/local/bin/palhm.py run backup
```

If your config runs on a read-only file system, it's safe to assume that the
config does not require a read-write file system in order to run. This means
your config does not modify the file system.

Also, you can always do a dry run of your backup task by setting the backend to
"**null**".
